    "Feature Engineering is the process of extracting and organizing the important features from raw data in such a way that it fits the purpose of the machine learning model. It can be thought of as the art of selecting the important features and transforming them into refined and meaningful features that suit the needs of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Engineering encapsulates various data engineering techniques such as selecting relevant features, handling missing data, encoding the data, and normalizing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is one of the most crucial tasks and plays a major role in determining the outcome of a model. In order to ensure that the chosen algorithm can perform to its optimum capability, it is important to engineer the features of the input data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is a machine learning technique that leverages data to create new variables that aren’t in the training set. It can produce new features for both supervised and unsupervised learning, with the goal of simplifying and speeding up data transformations while also enhancing model accuracy. Feature engineering is required when working with machine learning models. Regardless of the data or architecture, a terrible feature will have a direct impact on your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, Data Scientists deal with data extracted from massive open data sources such as the internet, surveys, or reviews. This data is crude and is known as raw data. It may contain missing values, unstructured data, incorrect inputs, and outliers. If we directly use this raw, un-processed data to train our models, we will land up with a model having a very poor efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus Feature Engineering plays an extremely pivotal role in determining the performance of any machine learning model.\n",

    "Higher efficiency of the model\n",
    "Easier Algorithms that fit the data\n",
    "Easier for Algorithms to detect patterns in the data\n",
    "Greater Flexibility of the features\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering consists of various process -\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Creation: Creating features involves creating new variables which will be most helpful for our model. This can be adding or removing some features. As we saw above, the cost per sq. ft column was a feature creation.\n",
    "Transformations: Feature transformation is simply a function that transforms features from one representation to another. The goal here is to plot and visualise data, if something is not adding up with the new features we can reduce the number of features used, speed up training, or increase the accuracy of a certain model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Extraction: Feature extraction is the process of extracting features from a data set to identify useful information. Without distorting the original relationships or significant information, this compresses the amount of data into manageable quantities for algorithms to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis : Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a powerful and simple tool that can be used to improve your understanding of your data, by exploring its properties. The technique is often applied when the goal is to create new hypotheses or find patterns in the data. It’s often used on large amounts of qualitative or quantitative data that haven’t been analyzed before.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmark : A Benchmark Model is the most user-friendly, dependable, transparent, and interpretable model against which you can measure your own. It’s a good idea to run test datasets to see if your new machine learning model outperforms a recognised benchmark. These benchmarks are often used as measures for comparing the performance between different machine learning models like neural networks and support vector machines, linear and non-linear classifiers, or different approaches like bagging and boosting. To learn more about feature engineering steps and process, check the links provided at the end of this article. Now, let’s have a look at why we need feature engineering in machine learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "Importance Of Feature Engineering:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Engineering is a very important step in machine learning. Feature engineering refers to the process of designing artificial features into an algorithm. These artificial features are then used by that algorithm in order to improve its performance, or in other words reap better results. Data scientists spend most of their time with data, and it becomes important to make models accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "When feature engineering activities are done correctly, the resulting dataset is optimal and contains all of the important factors that affect the business problem. As a result of these datasets, the most accurate predictive models and the most useful insights are produced.\n",

    "\n",
    "Feature Engineering Techniques for Machine Learning\n",
    "Lets see a few feature engineering best techniques that you can use. Some of the techniques listed may work better with certain algorithms or datasets, while others may be useful in all situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to preparing your data for machine learning, missing values are one of the most typical issues. Human errors, data flow interruptions, privacy concerns, and other factors could all contribute to missing values. Missing values have an impact on the performance of machine learning models for whatever cause. The main goal of imputation is to handle these missing values. There are two types of imputation :\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical Imputation: To figure out what numbers should be assigned to people currently in the population, we usually use data from completed surveys or censuses. These data sets can include information about how many people eat different types of food, whether they live in a city or country with a cold climate, and how much they earn every year. That is why numerical imputation is used to fill gaps in surveys or censuses when certain pieces of information are missing.\n",
    "#Filling all missing values with 0\n",
    "\n",
    "data = data.fillna(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical Imputation: When dealing with categorical columns, replacing missing values with the highest value in the column is a smart solution. However, if you believe the values in the column are evenly distributed and there is no dominating value, imputing a category like “Other” would be a better choice, as your imputation is more likely to converge to a random selection in this scenario.\n",
    "#Max fill function for categorical columns\n",
    "\n",
    "data[‘column_name’].fillna(data[‘column_name’].value_counts().idxmax(), inplace=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Handling Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlier handling is a technique for removing outliers from a dataset. This method can be used on a variety of scales to produce a more accurate data representation. This has an impact on the model’s performance. Depending on the model, the effect could be large or minimal; for example, linear regression is particularly susceptible to outliers. This procedure should be completed prior to model training. The various methods of handling outliers include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Removal: Outlier-containing entries are deleted from the distribution. However, if there are outliers across numerous variables, this strategy may result in a big chunk of the datasheet being missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replacing values: Alternatively, the outliers could be handled as missing values and replaced with suitable imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capping: Using an arbitrary value or a value from a variable distribution to replace the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discretization : Discretization is the process of converting continuous variables, models, and functions into discrete ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is accomplished by constructing a series of continuous intervals (or bins) that span the range of our desired variable/model/function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Log Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Log Transform is the most used technique among data scientists. It’s mostly used to turn a skewed distribution into a normal or less-skewed distribution. We take the log of the values in a column and utilise those values as the column in this transform. It is used to handle confusing data, and the data becomes more approximative to normal applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "//Log Example\n",
    "\n",
    "df[log_price] = np.log(df[‘Price’])\n",
    "\n",
    "4.One-hot encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-hot encoding is a type of encoding in which an element of a finite set is represented by the index in that set, where only one element has its index set to “1” and all other elements are assigned indices within the range [0, n-1]. In contrast to binary encoding schemes, where each bit can represent 2 values (i.e. 0 and 1), this scheme assigns a unique value for each possible case.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling is one of the most pervasive and difficult problems in machine learning, yet it’s one of the most important things to get right. In order to train a predictive model, we need data with a known set of features that needs to be scaled up or down as appropriate. This blog post will explain how feature scaling works and why it’s important as well as some tips for getting started with feature scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a scaling operation, the continuous features become similar in terms of range. Although this step isn’t required for many algorithms, it’s still a good idea to do so. Distance-based algorithms like k-NN and k-Means, on the other hand, require scaled continuous features as model input. There are two common ways for scaling :\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization : All values are scaled in a specified range between 0 and 1 via normalisation (or min-max normalisation). This modification has no influence on the feature’s distribution, however it does exacerbate the effects of outliers due to lower standard deviations. As a result, it is advised that outliers be dealt with prior to normalisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization: Standardization (also known as z-score normalisation) is the process of scaling values while accounting for standard deviation. If the standard deviation of features differs, the range of those features will likewise differ. The effect of outliers in the characteristics is reduced as a result. To arrive at a distribution with a 0 mean and 1 variance, all the data points are subtracted by their mean and the result divided by the distribution’s variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline and involves several important aspects, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction: This involves converting raw data into features that can be used as inputs for machine learning models. This can include transforming text data into numerical values, such as word counts or TF-IDF scores, or aggregating numerical data into higher-level features, such as means or standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection: This involves choosing a subset of the available features to use as inputs for the machine learning model. This can be done to reduce the dimensionality of the data, remove irrelevant or redundant features, or to improve model performance by only using the most important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling: This involves transforming the scale of the features so that they have a common range, such as 0 to 1. This can be important because some machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the scale of the inputs and can perform poorly if the features are on different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature creation: This involves creating new features from existing features, such as combining multiple features into a single feature or deriving new features from domain knowledge. Feature creation can be a powerful way to improve model performance by capturing complex relationships and patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature normalization: This involves transforming the distribution of the features so that they have a normal distribution, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This can be important for some machine learning algorithms that assume a normal distribution of the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, feature engineering is a highly iterative and creative process that requires a combination of domain knowledge, statistical analysis, and trial and error. The goal is to create features that are informative, meaningful, and representative of the underlying data, in order to improve the performance of machine learning models.\n",

    "Chi-square Test\n",
    "The Chi-square test is used for categorical features in a dataset. We calculate Chi-square between each feature and the target and select the desired number of features with the best Chi-square scores. In order to correctly apply the chi-squared in order to test the relation between various features in the dataset and the target variable, the following conditions have to be met: the variables have to be categorical, sampled independently and values should have an expected frequency greater than 5.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher’s Score\n",
    "Fisher score is one of the most widely used supervised feature selection methods. The algorithm which we will use returns the ranks of the variables based on the fisher’s score in descending order. We can then select the variables as per the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation Coefficient\n",
    "Correlation is a measure of the linear relationship of 2 or more variables. Through correlation, we can predict one variable from the other. The logic behind using correlation for feature selection is that the good variables are highly correlated with the target. Furthermore, variables should be correlated with the target but should be uncorrelated among themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "If two variables are correlated, we can predict one from the other. Therefore, if two features are correlated, the model only really needs one of them, as the second one does not add additional information. We will use the Pearson Correlation here.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to set an absolute value, say 0.5 as the threshold for selecting the variables. If we find that the predictor variables are correlated among themselves, we can drop the variable which has a lower correlation coefficient value with the target variable.

By default, it removes all zero-variance features, i.e., features that have the same value in all samples. We assume that features with a higher variance may contain more useful information, but note that we are not taking the relationship between feature variables or feature and target variables into account, which is one of the drawbacks of filter methods.\n",

The feature selection process is based on a specific machine learning algorithm that we are trying to fit on a given dataset. It follows a greedy search approach by evaluating all the possible combinations of features against the evaluation criterion. The wrapper methods usually result in better predictive accuracy than filter methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "Forward Feature Selection\n",
    "This is an iterative method wherein we start with the best performing variable against the target. Next, we select another variable that gives the best performance in combination with the first selected variable. This process continues until the preset criterion is achieved.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Feature Elimination\n",
    "‘Given an external estimator that assigns weights to features (e.g., the coefficients of a linear model), the goal of recursive feature elimination (RFE) is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features. First, the estimator is trained on the initial set of features and the importance of each feature is obtained either through a coef_ attribute or through a feature_importances_ attribute.\n",

There are several ways to do this, including bag-of-words, n-grams, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), and word embeddings.\n",

    "The central limit theorem states that when n is large enough, the sum of independent and identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that we have n = 25 random variables, we can use the central limit theorem to approximate the distribution of Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean of Y, E(Y), can be calculated by multiplying the mean of each X variable by the number of variables:\n",

    "E(Y) = n * E(X)\n",

    "Using the given PMF and assuming you have the mean and standard deviation for each X variable, you can calculate the mean and standard deviation of Y.\n",

    "Keep in mind that the central limit theorem is an approximation, and the accuracy of the estimation depends on the sample size and the distribution of the original random variables."
